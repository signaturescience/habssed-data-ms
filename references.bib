Furthermore, freshwater ecosystems are particularly susceptible to effects of environmental change, including influx of exogenous nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. To evaluate the impact of nitrogen loading on the microbial community structure of shallow freshwater lakes, water samples collected from Lake Shenandoah (Virginia, USA) were incubated with two concentrations of either ammonium, nitrate, or urea as a nitrogen source. The potential impact of these nitrogen compounds on the bacterial community structure was assessed via 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. At the phylum level, the dominant taxa in Lake Shenandoah were comprised of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, which were not affected by exposure to the various nitrogen treatments. Overall, there was not a significant shift in the diversity of the bacterial community of Lake Shenandoah with the addition of nitrogen sources, indicating this shallow system may be constrained by other environmental factors.},

Our study demonstrates that our modification of the original extraction protocol significantly increased DNA yields, with an average increase of 4.1-fold more DNA than with the standard approach. A comparison of the diversity after Illumina MiSeq sequencing of bacterial communities extracted with both the standard approach and the proposed one indicated that our modified protocol has no or little impact on the results. This protocol provides a relatively straight forward means to achieve higher yields of DNA from the extraction of SterivexTM cartridges without altering the community composition and will likely be of interest to a wide range of scientists that use techniques based on the recovery of DNA from filters.},
