## Abstract

Here we describe a publicly available environmental DNA (eDNA) sequence dataset, consisting of samples collected from a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) on Lake Erie. Samples were drawn before, during, and after a 2019 _Microcystis_ bloom, and sequenced using 3rd generation sequencing with the Oxford Nanopore MinION device.  eDNA sequences were classified taxonomically, and abundances of Harmful algal bloom (HAB) -associated taxa were estimated.  While the taxonomic data showed some evidence of human and _E. coli_ contamination, we found that the abundance of _Mycrocystis_ and other HAB-associated orgnisms significantly differs between pre- and post-bloom environments. The raw sequence data are available in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under accession number PRJNA812770.  Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) pose a significant and increasing risk, both to human health and to the Blue Economy, and genomic approaches to early detection promise to help mitigate these risks. As such, this dataset could be of interest to freshwater ecology research teams, or any stakeholders interested in the detection and mitigation of HABs.

# Value of the data

* The data provide a snapshot of the microbiota present before and during a *Microcystis* bloom.
* Understanding the taxonomic makeup of the freshwater micorbiome can give us insights into the dynamics of bloom formation.
* Any stakeholders interested in the dynamics of HABs in general, and *Microcystis* blooms specifically may find these data to be of value.

# Data Description


# Experimental design, materials and methods

We collected water samples from NOAA GLERL stations WE02 and WE13 during a 2019 *Mycrocystis* bloom in Lake Erie. Sampling excursions from these NOAA GLERL stations in the 2019 bloom season took place during pre-, peak, and post-bloom conditions. Samples were drawn using standard collection protocols [@steffen2017] at a water depth of 0.5m-1.5m. Metadata on the physical and chemical properties of the water at the time of sampling were also collected [@boedecker2020]. Collection sites are show in the map in Figure \ref{fig:map} (adapted from www.glerl.noaa.gov).

```

Biomass was collected onto 0.2 um Sterivex filters and kept on ice until they were returned to the lab where they were stored at -80C until extraction. Extraction protocol was adapted according to [@cruaud2017]. We then prepared the libraries for MinION sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing kit (initially the Rapid Sequencing Kit (SQK-RAD004) but transitioning to the Rapid Barcoding Kit 96 (SQK-RBK110.96) for later runs). We sequenced the eDNA from those samples using the ONT MinION Mk1C device, which performed base-calling and quality filtering using ONT's embedded MinKNOW software using the default settings. We then performed taxonomic classification using the ONT What's In My Pot (WIMP) pipeline and counted the abundance of *Microcystis* reads, as well as species and strains within the *Microcystis* genus where possible. We computed the relative abundance by dividing these counts by the total number of reads passing the QC filters for the same samples.
